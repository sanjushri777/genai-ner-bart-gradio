## Development of a Named Entity Recognition (NER) Prototype Using a Fine-Tuned BART Model and Gradio Framework

### AIM:
To design and develop a prototype application for Named Entity Recognition (NER) by leveraging a fine-tuned BART model and deploying the application using the Gradio framework for user interaction and evaluation.

### PROBLEM STATEMENT:


1. **Entity Recognition**: Identify and classify named entities (e.g., persons, organizations, locations) from unstructured text using a pre-trained and fine-tuned model.

2. **Model Selection and Fine-Tuning**: Utilize a BART model and fine-tune it on a suitable Named Entity Recognition (NER) dataset to improve its accuracy for the task.

3. **User Interaction and Evaluation**: Build an interactive web interface using Gradio to allow users to input text and view recognized entities, facilitating easy evaluation and testing of the NER model's performance.

### DESIGN STEPS:

#### STEP 1: Model Selection and Fine-Tuning
Choose a pre-trained BART model (e.g., `facebook/bart-large`).
 Fine-tune the model on a NER dataset (e.g., CoNLL-03).

#### STEP 2:Pipeline Creation
Load the fine-tuned BART model and tokenizer using the `transformers` library.
Create a NER pipeline to extract named entities from input text.

#### STEP 3: Gradio Interface Development
Develop a Gradio interface to accept text input and display extracted entities.
Deploy the interface for user interaction.


### PROGRAM:
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForTokenClassification
from transformers import pipeline
import gradio as gr


model_name = "dbmdz/bert-large-cased-finetuned-conll03-english"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForTokenClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)

ner_pipeline = pipeline("ner", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)

def ner_function(text):
    entities = ner_pipeline(text)
    if entities:
        return "\n".join([f"{ent['word']} ({ent['entity']})" for ent in entities])
    else:
        return "No named entities found."

# Gradio Interface
iface = gr.Interface(
    fn=ner_function,
    inputs=gr.Textbox(lines=5, label="Input Text"),
    outputs=gr.Textbox(lines=10, label="Named Entities"),
    title="NER Demo with Pre-trained Model",
    description="This application performs Named Entity Recognition (NER) using a fine-tuned BERT model on the CoNLL-03 dataset."
)

iface.launch()
```
